# Components

I've already mentioned components several times in the previous chapters. Now we'll finally have a look at them.

In short, components are independent parts of your application that can communicate with each other. They are used in a parent-child model: The main app can have components and each component can have child components that again can have child components. This means that each component has a parent, whereas the main app is at the top of this tree structure and therefore does not have a parent.

To showcase this, we will create a small application which opens a dialog when it gets closed. The headerbar and the dialog will be implemented as standalone components. The communication to the main application will be done via outputs.

## When to use components

Components are mainly useful for separating parts of the UI into smaller, more manageable parts. They are not necessary but for larger applications, they can be very helpful.

## Message handling

Simple components store their child components inside the `Model` as a `Controller<ChildModel>` and handle output messages in the `init` function by calling the `forward` method.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
struct Model {
    child: Controller<ChildModel>,
}

fn init(counter: Self::InitParams, root: &Self::Root, sender: &ComponentSender<Self>) -> ComponentParts<Self> {
    let mut model = Model { 
        child: CounterModel::builder().launch(()).forward(&sender.input, |message| match message {
            CounterOutput::SendFront(index) => AppMsg::SendFront(index),
            CounterOutput::MoveUp(index) => AppMsg::MoveUp(index),
            CounterOutput::MoveDown(index) => AppMsg::MoveDown(index),
        })  
    };
    let widgets = view_output!();
    ComponentParts { model, widgets }
}
```

The `forward` method will redirect the output messages from the child component and transform them into the parent's input messages and handled in the `update` function.

> Components are independent from one another, a component might communicate with many other components, therefore, the child component doesn't know who that parent will be, so, the output from the `child` has to be handled by the `parent`. 

# Example application

Let's write a small example app to see how components can be used in action. For this example, we write parts of an app that can edit images.

> The app we will write in this chapter is also available [here](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/relm4/blob/main/relm4-examples/examples/components.rs). Run `cargo run --example components` from the [example directory](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/relm4/tree/main/relm4-examples) if you want to see the code in action.

## The header bar

Our first component will be a header bar. There are not a lot of advantages for writing this component except for reducing the complexity in other parts of our UI.

The header bar will have three buttons for three modes that our application can have:

+ **View:** View the image.
+ **Edit:** Edit the image.
+ **Export:** Export the image in different formats.

We will not implement the actual functionality, but use placeholders instead to keep things simple.

### The model

Usually you want to store everything that only affects your component in the state of the component. In this case however, there is no state that can be stored in the component, but only state that affects the root component (app). Therefore, we leave the model empty and only send messages to the root component.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:header_model }}
```

The message type allows us to switch between the modes.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:header_msg }}
```

Our component needs no `update` method, because the `view` can emit the component's output messages as part of its click signal handlers, as we will see in the next section.

### The widgets

There's nothing special about widgets of a child component. The only difference to the main app component is that the root widget doesn't need to be a `gtk::Window`. Instead, we use a `gtk::HeaderBar` here, but theoretically the root widget doesn't even need to be a widget at all (which can be useful in special cases).

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:header_widgets }}
```

## The close alert

Like a normal application that's used to edit files, we want to notify the user before accidentally closing the application and discarding all progress. For this &mdash; you might have guessed it already &mdash; we will use another component.

### The model

The state of the dialog only needs to store whether or not it's hidden.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:dialog_model }}
```

The message contains three options:

+ Show is used by the parent to display the dialog.
+ Accept is used internally to indicate that the user agreed to close the application.
+ Cancel is used internally to indicate that the user changes his mind and doesn't want to close the application.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:dialog_msg }}
```

### The widgets

Unlike the last component, the `DialogModel` component doesn't send its output messages from a signal handler. Instead, the `response` signal handler sends *input* messages to itself, handles them in `update`, and then sends output messages if necessary. This is a common pattern for more complex components.

> If your component accepts non-internal inputs as well, you may want to mark the internal variants as `#[doc(hidden)]` so that users of your component know they're only intended for internal use.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:dialog_widgets }}
```

In the `update` implementation, we match the input messages and emit an output if needed.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:dialog_update }}
```

## The main app

Now all parts come together to form a single app.

### The model

First, let's define the model of the main app and its messages.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:app_model }}
```

The `AppMode` struct stores the modes the application can be in. The `SetMode` message is transformed from the output of our header bar component to update the state of the main application when someone presses a button in the header bar. The `Close` message is transformed from the output of the dialog component to indicate that the window should be closed.

In the model, we store the current `AppMode` as well as a `Controller` for each of our child components.

The update function of the model is pretty straightforward.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:app_update }}
```

We can retrieve a sender for the child component by calling the `sender()` method on the associated `Controller`, and then send messages of the associated `Input` type through it.

### Controllers

When initializing the app component, we construct the child components by passing the appropriate `InitParams` and forwarding any desired inputs and outputs. This is done through a builder provided by `Component` implementations. We pass the initial parameters via the `launch` method, and then retrieve the final `Controller` by calling the `forward` method. In addition to starting the component, the `forward` method allows us to take the outputs of the component, transform them with a mapping function, and then pass the result as an input message to another sender (in this case, the input sender of the app component). If you don't need to forward any outputs, you can start the component with the `detach` method instead.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:app_init }}
```

Also, we set the `set_transient_for` property, which actually uses the main window. The dialog should set his parent window so that GTK can handle the dialog better. The GTK docs state: "[set_transient_for] allows window managers to e.g. keep the dialog on top of the main window, or center the dialog over the main window".

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:app_model }}
```

### The widgets

We're almost done! Lastly, let's take a look at the app widgets.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:app_widgets }}
```

Most notably, we retrieve the root widget of our header component through the `widget()` method on the associated `Controller` to set it as a child of the main window.

## Conclusion

You now know most of the secrets that Relm4 offers. Components can be powerful and if they are implemented correctly, they are even reusable across different apps. The relm4-components crate offers several reusable components you can use in your applications. In the following chapters, we'll look at an even simpler component type called worker, how to implement reusable components yourself and how to use components with async code and multiple threads.

## The complete code

Let's review our code in one piece one more time to see how all these parts work together:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/components.rs:all }}
```
