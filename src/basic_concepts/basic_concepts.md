# Basic concepts

Before we start building our app, we need to understand the basic concepts of Relm4. If you have experience with GTK and Rust, you will probably breeze through this section, but if you don't, this section is for you.

We will explain to detail how Relm4 works and how to use it, what the `Model` is, what `Components` are, how they produce `Widgets`, and how communication occurs with the help of `Messages`.

After this section, we will be building a simple counter app.
