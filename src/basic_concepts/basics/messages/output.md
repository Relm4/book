# Output messages

**Output** messages are sent by components to other components and handled differently depending on the type of components that receives them. We can think of them as our outbox ðŸšš.

Let take our previous `MailboxComponent` example and add the following.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
enum Outbox {
    SendEmail(Email),
}
```

We can take our previous example and send one of the emails to somebody else.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
match message {
    Outbox::SendEmail(email) => EmailProvider::SendEmail(email)
}
```

> This is handled in the parent component.

When we send the email, out outbox will deliver that email to the email provider, in this case, our `EmailProvider` component will take care of delivering our email.

`EmailProvider` is the parent component of `MailboxComponent`.
