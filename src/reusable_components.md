# Reusable components

In this chapter, we will implement a simple alert dialog as a reusable component.

The alert example in the Relm4 repository implements a simple app for the reusable alert component we will write in this chapter. It's an other variant of a counter app, yet this time a dialog will be displayed if the counter does not match 42 when being closed. The main difference in the implementation is, that the dialog is implemented as component that can be reused in other applications.

This is how the dialog looks like in the alert example:

> If you want to see an alert component, very similar to the one we will write in this chapter, used inside a Relm4 application have a look at the [“alert” example](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/relm4/blob/main/relm4-examples/examples/alert.rs). Run `cargo run --example alert` from the [example directory](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/relm4/tree/main/relm4-examples) if you want to see the code in action.

Reusable components don’t know their parent component at the time they are implemented. So if they want to interact with their parent component, they must assume that their parent model implements a trait as an interface for the component.

## The parent traits

First, we’ll have a look at the traits the parent component, that will eventually use this component, has to implement.

Because we want our component to be flexible and able to display different messages, we first define a data type for configuring our component.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:settings }}
```

Next, we define a trait for our parent model that defines the messages our component will send to respond to the parent. The trait also defines a function that passes a new configuration to our component.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:parent_trait }}
```

Because you usually want to tell GTK to which window a dialog belongs to, we also add a trait that allows us to pass the parent window.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:parent_widgets_trait }}
```

## The model

Our model stores whether the component is visible and the configuration.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:model }}
```

The message type only exposes the `Show` message to the parent component. The `Response` message is used internally for handling user interactions, so we hide it with `#[doc(hidden)]`.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:msg }}
```

The `ComponentUpdate` trait would usually expect the parent component as a generic type. We don’t know the parent component yet, so we add trait bounds to a new generic type.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:component_update_start }}
```

For initializing our model, we get the configuration from our parent component and set `is_active` to `false`.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:init_model }}
```

The update function handles the `Show` message from our parent component and the `Response` messages generated by user interactions. It also sends the appropriate messages to the parent.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:component_update }}
```

## The widgets

The widgets have a generic type for the parent component with the expected trait bounds, too. Because they are part of a public interface, we also add the `pub` attribute to the widget macro. Apart from that, there is nothing special.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:widgets }}
```

## Conclusion

We’re done! That’s your first reusable component.

> You can find more examples of reusable components in the relm4-components crate [here](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/relm4/tree/main/relm4-components). You can also contribute your own reusable components to relm4-components :)

## The complete code

Let’s review our code in one piece one more time to see how all these parts work together:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../examples/alert.rs:all }}
```
